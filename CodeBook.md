First of all, I will talk about some details about my cleandata.xlsx. In the cleandata.xlsx file, I store the final tidy data set hello_data in this file. This hello_data is a data.frame which has average value of every variable for each activity(WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS,WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,SATNDING,LAYING).
Notice that the cleandata.xlsx has average value (unit:HZ) of different variables(only includes mean and standard deviation measurements)  based on different activity label names(WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS,WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,SATNDING,LAYING). The first column of the xlsx file is the activity names. 
As you can see, cleandata.xlsx has column names which correspond to all thr mean and standard deviation measurements: 
average of tBodyAcc-mean()-X	
average of tBodyAcc-mean()-Y	
average of tBodyAcc-mean()-Z	
average of tBodyAcc-std()-X	
average of tBodyAcc-std()-Y
average of tBodyAcc-std()-Z
average of tGravityAcc-mean()-X	
average of tGravityAcc-mean()-Y	
average of tGravityAcc-mean()-Z	
average of tGravityAcc-std()-X	
average of tGravityAcc-std()-Y	
average of tGravityAcc-std()-Z	
average of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X	
average of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
average of tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z
average of tBodyAccJerk-std()-X	
average of tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y	
average of tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z	
average of tBodyGyro-mean()-X	
average of tBodyGyro-mean()-Y	
average of tBodyGyro-mean()-Z	
average of tBodyGyro-std()-X	
average of tBodyGyro-std()-Y	
average of tBodyGyro-std()-Z	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y	
average of tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z	
average of tBodyAccMag-mean()	
average of tBodyAccMag-std()	
average of tGravityAccMag-mean()	
average of tGravityAccMag-std()	
average of tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()	
average of tBodyAccJerkMag-std()	
average of tBodyGyroMag-mean()	
average of tBodyGyroMag-std()	
average of tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()	
average of tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()	
average of fBodyAcc-mean()-X	
average of fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
average of fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
average of fBodyAcc-std()-X	
average of fBodyAcc-std()-Y
average of fBodyAcc-std()-Z
average of fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X
average of fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y	
average of fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z	
average of fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X	
average of fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y	
average of fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z	
average of fBodyAccJerk-std()-X	
average of fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y	
average of fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z	
average of fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X	
average of fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y	
average of fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z	
average of fBodyGyro-mean()-X	
average of fBodyGyro-mean()-Y	
average of fBodyGyro-mean()-Z	
average of fBodyGyro-std()-X	
average of fBodyGyro-std()-Y	
average of fBodyGyro-std()-Z	
average of fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X	
average of fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y	
average of fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z	
average of fBodyAccMag-mean()	
average of fBodyAccMag-std()	
average of fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()	
average of fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()	
average of fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()	
average of fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()	
average of fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq(). 

Then, the cleandata.xlsx shows average value of differnt variables above based on different activity names(WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS,WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,SATNDING,LAYING). The unit for average value is HZ.
